Deep Engineering Website UI/UX & Content Guide
Information Architecture
Homepage – A full-screen hero section with a powerful tagline and background (image or subtle
animation). Below the hero, include key highlights: an Overview of KPP Technology, a snapshot of
Projects (e.g. planned 300 MW in Kurdistan Region ), a brief About Us summary, and a Call-to-
Action (contact link or button). Each section should tease deeper content with links to the relevant
pages.
About – Company background and mission. Highlight that Deep Engineering is an “Iraqi Renewable
Energy Project Developer” founded in 2019 in Erbil (branch in Basra) . Emphasize core focus areas
(renewable generation, smart-grid retrofits, project planning ) and credentials. Include company
achievements (e.g. “90 MW KPP project in Samawah and 300 MW in KRG in development” ) and the
exclusive partnership with Rosch Innovations (technology provider) . This page can be sectioned
into Who We Are, Our Focus, Our Team (with a grid of team member profiles), and Our Partners. Keep
the tone professional and visionary.
Technology (KPP) – This section contains multiple subpages detailing the Kinetic Power Plant
technology:
KPP Overview – Explain in accessible terms what the Kinetic Power Plant is and why it’s innovative.
For example: “The Kinetic Power Plant (KPP) is an innovative power generation system that uses buoyancy
and gravity instead of fuel, producing electricity 24/7 with no combustion and zero emissions” .
Highlight that it provides continuous, clean power anywhere without reliance on weather or fossil
fuel . Mention it’s developed by Rosch (Germany) with global demonstrations . This page
should also list key benefits (clean, continuous, decentralized, scalable – see UX/Copy below).
How KPP Works – A deep-dive into the science and mechanics. Use diagrams or animations to
illustrate the physics principles (Archimedes’ buoyancy, gravity, etc.) and a step-by-step
walkthrough of the energy generation cycle. Keep text sections bite-sized with clear headings (e.g.
“Buoyancy-Driven Motion”, “Energy Conversion Cycle”). Consider embedding a short explanatory video
or interactive animation demonstrating the air injection engine and moving floaters (the
presentation had an “Air Driven Engine” video and step-by-step visuals).
KPP Components – Detail the major system components and design. Break out sub-sections or
pages for System Design & Components (e.g. floaters, water tank, chain system, generator,
compressor, control system). Each component can have a brief description and technical highlight.
For example: “500 kW Low-Speed Permanent Magnet Generator – runs at 375 RPM with ~95% efficiency,
enabling direct grid connection without gearboxes” . Use images or icons for each part (a water drop
icon for water tank, bolt icon for mechanical parts, etc.). If content is long, consider splitting into
“Components (Part 1, Part 2)” pages as in the technical overview.
Performance & Specs – Provide technical credibility with data. Include subsections on Performance
(e.g. output 1 MW and 5 MW module options, availability 100%, load profiles) and Environmental
Impact (zero emissions, minimal water use – “<5% of water recirculation needs periodic top-up”, etc.). If

available, present the Water Consumption Analysis (the tech overview analyzes water usage )
and maintenance expectations. Use charts or infographics for clarity.
All technology pages should have a consistent sub-navigation (or clearly accessible links) so users can easily
explore the different aspects. Maintain an authoritative but approachable tone (explain technical terms in
plain language where possible).
Projects – Showcase Deep Engineering’s current and planned projects. Use a portfolio grid or list
format with an image, project name, size, and status for each. For example, cards for each planned
power plant: Zakho – 100 MW (Kurdistan, in progress), Soran – 100 MW, Raparin – 50 MW, Garmian –
50 MW . Also include the 90 MW Samawah project with the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity . Each
project entry can link to a detail page or pop-up with more info (location, partners, timeline). Focus
on the impact (e.g. “providing clean energy for X homes”). Use consistent imagery (site photos or
renderings, or use a map graphic with pins for project sites).
Team – Profile the leadership and key team members. A clean grid of headshots with names, titles,
and a brief bio or expertise area. Since the company has ~35 staff across mechanical, electrical,
SCADA, finance disciplines , highlight the breadth of expertise. This page can also emphasize the
company culture or any career opportunities (if relevant). Keep the design minimalistic – simple
cards or a list that expands on click for the bio.
Contact – Provide an easy way for visitors to get in touch. Include a contact form (name, email,
message fields) with a clear call-to-action like “Send Message” and a success confirmation. Also list
the company’s contact details: address of HQ in Erbil and branch in Basra, phone number, and email.
Optionally, embed a map for the HQ location. Ensure the form is CMS-ready: the form submission
can be handled via an API or service, but the content (address, emails) should be editable via the
CMS. Keep this page straightforward, with a short inviting text (e.g. “Have questions or project
inquiries? We’d love to hear from you.”).
The navigation menu should include the main sections: Home, About, Technology, Projects, Team,
Contact. The “Technology” item can have a dropdown for the subpages (Overview, How It Works,
Components, etc.) or go to the overview with internal links. Use a sticky header so navigation is always
accessible. Also include footer navigation with these links plus social media if applicable.
UX & Copywriting
The content should be clear, engaging, and technically credible. All copy should reflect a confident,
innovative tone – positioning Deep Engineering as a leader in cutting-edge renewable energy in Iraq. Below
are key content elements and suggested copy:
Hero Section (Homepage):
Tagline: A succinct, powerful statement encapsulating the value proposition. For example:
“Continuous Clean Energy, Anywhere.” This conveys 24/7 renewable power available at any
location, echoing KPP’s unique benefit of siting power plants wherever needed .
Subtagline: One sentence for clarity. E.g.: “Delivering 24/7 renewable power through the revolutionary
Kinetic Power Plant (KPP) technology – no fuel, no emissions.” This reinforces the key differentiators
(continuous, fuel-free, clean) .

Call to Action: A prominent button like “Learn More” (scrolls to Technology section) or “Our
Technology”, and maybe a secondary “Contact Us” button for immediate inquiries.
About Page Copy: Use an “About Us” heading or a brief intro: “Deep Engineering is Iraq’s pioneer in
renewable energy project development, turning innovative technology into sustainable power.” Expand on
the company’s story: e.g. “Founded in 2019 in Erbil, with a branch in Basra, Deep Engineering has
assembled a multidisciplinary team to drive Iraq’s clean energy future .” Highlight credibility: “As
the exclusive KPP licensee for Iraq , we are deploying world-class kinetic power plants to deliver reliable
green electricity.” Keep paragraphs concise. Use subheadings for Mission, History, Partners etc., if
needed. For instance, under Our Mission, a line like: “To bridge the gap in reliable power supply by
harnessing innovative technologies that provide clean, continuous energy for Iraq and beyond.”
Technology Section Copy: This content must balance technical detail with clarity. Structure it with
descriptive headings and bullet points:
Overview: Provide a short intro as above. Then use a features list (with microcopy similar to Ki-Tech’s
messaging) to emphasize Why KPP:
Clean Power: “Operates without any fuel, water, wind or solar input – generating electricity with
zero emissions (no CO₂, NOx, or other pollutants) .”
Continuous Power: “Provides stable baseload power 24/7, independent of weather conditions
, with built-in redundancy ensuring near 100% uptime.”
Decentralized: “Can be installed at the point of need – even off-grid locations – reducing
transmission losses .”
Scalable: “Modular design allows capacity from a few megawatts to 100+ MW by paralleling units
. Start with what you need and expand easily.”
Small Footprint: “Requires far less land than solar or wind: ~300 m² per MW (vs. thousands for
other sources) .”
Competitive: “Projected levelized cost ~€25/MWh – delivering affordable energy along with
grid stability benefits.”
Each feature can have a heading (perhaps with an icon) and a one-sentence explanation, as
above. This microcopy should be punchy and fact-based.
How It Works: Explain in simple steps the KPP cycle. For example, a sequence might be: 1) Air is
injected into underwater floaters, causing them to rise. 2) The rising floaters drive a chain that turns a
generator. 3) At the top, air is released and the floater sinks back down to repeat the cycle. Use an active
voice and present tense to make it engaging (like a tour of the process). Include a note on the
physics: “By leveraging Archimedes’ Principle (buoyancy) and gravity in a closed-loop, KPP continuously
converts mechanical motion into electricity.” Keep each step description short; consider using an
infographic with labels.
Technical Details: Write approachable descriptions for complex components. Instead of raw specs,
frame them in terms of benefits: e.g., “High-Efficiency Generator: A 500 kW permanent-magnet
generator runs at low RPM, eliminating complex gearboxes and improving reliability .” Or “Smart
Control System: An integrated SCADA ensures optimal performance and safety, automatically adjusting air
input and monitoring output in real-time.” If there are unique terms (like SCADA), briefly explain
(“Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system”). Use metric units and standard terms
consistently. Aim for a tone that is confident and factual, avoiding marketing exaggeration.

Throughout the tech pages, use microcopy to guide the reader: e.g., labels on diagrams (“Buoyancy
Drives Rotation → Power Generation”), captions under images (“KPP module schematic”), or tooltips
for jargon. These small text elements should be concise and helpful. For example, on a diagram of
the KPP module, micro-labels might point out “Floaters rising in water (buoyant force)”, “Generator
converts motion to electricity”, etc.
Projects Page Copy: For each project, include a short description that gives context. E.g., “Zakho
100 MW – Four KPP units of 25 MW each, providing continuous power to the region. Partnered with KRG
Ministry of Electricity, expected commissioning 2025.” Keep project descriptions 1-2 sentences, focusing
on the outcome and status. An introduction paragraph for the page can state: “Deep Engineering is
currently developing 390 MW of KPP projects across Iraq to deliver clean energy where it’s needed
most. Our projects range from large utility-scale plants to regional power solutions.”
Team Page Copy: Open with a friendly invite like “Meet the Team behind Deep Engineering”. For each
member, list their name, title, and a one-liner highlighting their expertise or role (e.g., “John Doe –
Project Lead, 10+ years in renewable project management”). Microcopy tip: instead of a generic “Team”
heading, consider something like “Our Leadership & Experts” for a bit more personality. If space
allows, a quote or personal mission from the CEO/managing partner could be nice, but keep it short
and relevant (e.g., “Our goal is to secure a sustainable energy future for Iraq – Eng. Ranj Sherko,
Managing Partner.”).
Contact Page Copy: Keep it straightforward and welcoming. A heading like “Get in Touch” or “Let’s
Talk” works well. A sentence or two: “Interested in our technology or projects? Send us a message and
we’ll respond promptly.” On the form, use microcopy to guide users: placeholder text like “Your
Name”, “Your Email”, “How can we help you?” or field labels. The submit button could say “Send
Message” and a confirmation message like “Thank you for reaching out – we’ll get back to you soon.” If
listing addresses, you can use a subheading like “Offices” and list Erbil and Basra with full
addresses. Ensure tone is polite and encouraging.
General Copy Style: Throughout the site, maintain a professional and clear style. Use short sentences
and avoid overly technical jargon without explanation. Where technical terms are necessary, assume a
smart but non-specialist reader and add a brief clarification (e.g., “500 kW (kilowatt) generator”). Write in
active voice and present tense to make it immediate. For example, instead of “The KPP technology has been
demonstrated to be effective,” say “KPP technology delivers reliable power – proven in demonstrations in
Germany, Thailand, and more.” . This keeps the text engaging.
Finally, ensure all headings and subheadings are informative. A user scanning the page should grasp the
key points from headings alone. For instance, on the tech page, instead of a vague heading like
“Innovation”, use “Fuel-Free, Emissions-Free” or “Continuous 24/7 Operation” as section titles – this
immediately conveys the message even without reading the paragraph.

Visual Design
The design will draw inspiration from Vestas’s modern, minimalistic, and elegant aesthetic. We aim for a
clean corporate look with a renewable energy feel. Key visual design guidelines:
Color Palette: Base the palette on the Deep Engineering logo and Vestas-like blues. Likely a deep
blue as the primary brand color (for example, a navy or azure tone similar to Vestas’ blue). In the
provided materials, a dark blue around #18335A was dominant in the logo . Use this or a close
hex ( #152D47 or #04318F as seen in the theme config ) for headers, footer backgrounds,
and call-to-action buttons. Complement it with a bright accent blue (e.g. #2150FE from the design
theme ) for highlights, links, or hover states. White and light gray will provide the clean
background and contrast. For instance, use an off-white ( #F0F0F1 or pure #FFFFFF) as the page
background , with plenty of whitespace to echo a minimal feel. Neutral grays (e.g. #4C4C4D text
gray ) should be used for body text and secondary elements, ensuring readability on light
background. Consider a secondary accent in a warm tone (perhaps an orange or rust, e.g.
#C84209 was suggested in the style guide) used sparingly for things like important buttons or
hover effects to add visual interest . Overall, the palette should feel “cool, professional, and
modern” with blues and grays , aligning with a clean energy theme.
Typography: Use a combination of a professional sans-serif and a elegant serif, mirroring modern
corporate trends. The provided theme uses Crimson Pro (serif) for headings and Heebo (sans-serif)
for body text . This is a strong pairing: Crimson Pro brings a touch of sophistication and trust
(great for titles/taglines), while Heebo is clean and highly legible for content. Both fonts are Google
Fonts, ensuring easy integration. If these exact fonts are not desired, alternatives could be
Merriweather or Playfair Display for serif, and Inter or Lato for sans-serif – but sticking to
Crimson Pro/Heebo is fine given they were already chosen. Font sizes should be generous, especially
on the homepage – e.g. hero title ~4rem (scaling to maybe 6rem on large screens) to create an
impactful statement, and body text around 1rem (16px) for comfortable reading. Use consistent lineheights
(e.g. 1.5) and spacing. Headings should be bold or semi-bold (Crimson Pro 600 weight was
used ) with a distinct color (maybe the deep blue) , whereas body text can be a dark gray for
contrast against pure black (easier on eyes). Ensure the typographic hierarchy is clear: use different
sizes/weights for H1, H2, H3, etc., and make sure link text or buttons stand out (perhaps in the
accent blue).
Layout & Grid: Use a responsive grid system with plenty of whitespace. Tailwind CSS’s built-in grid
and flex utilities will handle this. For a content width, consider using a max width container (~1280px
or so) centered on larger screens (Tailwind’s container class with appropriate breakpoints).
Margins/padding should be generous to give an open, airy feel (inspired by Vestas’ spacious layouts).
For example, use a 12-column grid for the overall layout. The homepage sections can use full-width
background with content centered in the max-width container. The “About” and “Technology” pages
might use a two-column layout: text on one side, image on the other, on desktop (stacked on
mobile). Maintain consistent gutters (space between columns, e.g. gap-8 in Tailwind for 2rem gap).
Use fullscreen sections where appropriate (the hero is fullscreen by design). For interior pages, a
common approach is a hero banner area (shorter) with a page title, then content grid. Keep the
visual hierarchy such that the most important content (headings, key images) draws attention first.
Align text to a baseline grid and use Tailwind’s utility classes to ensure consistency (e.g. same margin
bottom on all headings, etc.). The design should be fully responsive: on mobile, use a single-column

layout, stacking elements; on desktop, introduce multi-column grids. Test for various screen sizes so
that no text is too cramped or too wide (limit paragraphs to reasonable width for readability, ~65-75
characters per line is ideal).
Imagery & Illustration: Favor modern vector illustrations and high-quality images that reinforce
the content. Since KPP is a novel technology, consider using 3D renders or diagrams to visually
explain it (the technical overview included generated images of the KPP module, which can be
repurposed). If available, incorporate imagery of kinetic power plant modules or concept art –
perhaps stylized cutaways or schematic-like illustrations. The style prompt in the design file suggests
“Blues, grays, bright, professional, modern” visuals – so illustrations should use the brand colors
(blue/gray) and a clean, flat or semi-flat style (think isometric industrial illustrations or outline icons
with accent colors). Avoid cluttered or overly cartoonish graphics; everything should feel sleek and
engineered. Icons will play a big role for quick visual communication: use Heroicons (a clean,
consistent icon set) for things like feature bullets (e.g. a leaf icon for “Clean Power”, a lightning bolt
for “Continuous Power”, a location marker for “Decentralized”, etc.). Heroicons’ outline style will
match a minimalist aesthetic and can be styled with the brand colors easily. Use icons at a moderate
size (24px or 32px) alongside text. All images and illustrations should be optimized for web (Next.js’s
Image component can help with responsive sizes).
Visual Consistency: Maintain a consistent look across the site. This means using the same color
shades for similar elements (Tailwind can have a custom theme configured with these brand colors,
e.g., primary: '#18335a' , secondary: '#2150FE' , etc.). Buttons should have a uniform style
(e.g. filled primary color for main CTAs, outline or ghost style for secondary actions). Form elements
should use the same design language (e.g. light gray backgrounds, maybe slight border radius of
4px, blue focus outline for inputs to match brand color). Use subtle shadows or depth sparingly to
highlight interactive cards or to make text on images readable. For example, project cards can have a
small shadow ( shadow-md ) and hover elevation ( hover:shadow-lg ) to indicate interactivity,
aligning with modern design trends. Animations (see next section) will also be part of the visual feel,
but ensure they are subtle and do not detract from the clean design.
Accessibility & Contrast: Given the professional nature, ensure sufficient contrast (the deep blue on
white is good for text; avoid light gray text on white for body copy as it might be too low-contrast).
Provide alt text for images (especially any diagrams explaining tech). Use accessible font sizes and
consider color-blind friendliness (the blue/orange combo is generally okay, but check that any critical
info isn’t conveyed by color alone). A minimalistic design can still be very accessible by sticking to
simple layouts and clear text.
In summary, the visual design should convey innovation, trust, and cleanliness – much like Vestas’ site
which uses large whitespace, clear blues, and modern typography to great effect. By using a coherent color
palette (rooted in blues/whites), strong typographic hierarchy with a mix of serif/sans, and clean graphics,
the Deep Engineering site will look both professional and inviting to stakeholders and visitors.

Animations
Animations will add a layer of modern interactivity, but they should remain sleek and not overwhelming
(keeping with a minimal elegant feel). Here are recommendations for animation usage and libraries:
Library Choices: We recommend using Framer Motion or GSAP (GreenSock) for implementing
animations in Next.js. Both are well-suited for React/Next; Framer Motion integrates naturally with
React components (declarative animations), whereas GSAP offers more fine-grained control for
complex sequences. In general, Framer Motion shines for simple component animations and scrolltriggered
reveal effects, while GSAP is powerful for timeline-controlled animations or advanced
effects . For most UI flourishes (fades, slides, modals), Framer Motion should suffice. If you plan
on elaborate animations (like detailed SVG drawings or canvas effects), GSAP (possibly with its
ScrollTrigger plugin) is a great addition. Both can coexist if needed. Additionally, consider using
React Spring or Framer Motion for physics-based or interactive UI animations and Lottie (via
lottie-react package) if you have any Lottie animation files (e.g., an animated diagram or logo
motion graphic).
Hero Section Animation: The homepage hero is a prime area for a subtle "wow" effect. For
example, you could have a background video or loop (perhaps abstract water and air bubbles
rising, hinting at KPP’s principle) playing muted behind the tagline. If not a video, a particle
animation or slowly animating graphic can work – e.g., floating geometric shapes or an outline of
the KPP module slowly drawing in. Keep it low-key so text stays readable (use overlay or blur if
needed). The hero text itself can animate in: for instance, using Framer Motion’s animate prop to
fade-up the tagline and subtext sequentially, with a slight delay, giving a polished entrance. A quick
example: the tagline slides from the bottom with opacity 0 to 100% over 0.8s, and the subtagline
fades in right after. The call-to-action button might have a hover animation, like a slight upward lift
or a ripple effect on click (achievable with CSS or small JS). These animations draw attention without
being distracting. Avoid heavy animations that could impact performance on load; use techniques
like Next.js’s lazy loading for any video or ensure the CSS animations are not janky.
Section Transitions: As users scroll, each section (About, Technology, etc.) can have a gentle reveal.
For example, the About section text might fade in and rise slightly as it enters the viewport (use
Framer Motion’s whileInView or a library like AOS – Animate on Scroll – if you prefer a utility
approach). Images can have a slight zoom-in or parallax drift on scroll. A modern effect used in
many renewable energy websites is a parallax background – e.g., an image of a wind farm (or in
your case maybe a landscape with infrastructure) that moves slower than the foreground text when
scrolling. You can implement this with CSS or JS (Framer Motion can animate
backgroundPosition or use GSAP’s ScrollTrigger to update on scroll). Ensure section transition
animations are consistent: e.g., use the same duration and easing for all fade-ups (say 0.5s ease-out)
so the site feels cohesive.
Interactive Elements: Use micro-interactions to enhance UX. For instance, navigation menu items
can have a hover underline animation (like a sliding underline or a color fade). Using Tailwind, you
might do this with CSS transitions, or use a small Motion component to underline on hover. Buttons
should have hover states (color change or slight scale-up) – Tailwind’s transition-transform
and hover:scale-105 can do a quick scale, and hover:bg-primary-darker for color. Form

inputs might highlight on focus with a smooth box-shadow expansion (e.g., via CSS transition
on focus). These subtle cues make the site feel modern and responsive to the user.
Scroll-based Effects: Given the technical nature of KPP, consider scroll-triggered animations to tell
a story. For example, on the "How KPP Works" page, as the user scrolls down a step-by-step
diagram, you could animate each step: the floater rises, the chain moves, the generator spins –
using an SVG or Lottie animation controlled by scroll position. This could be done with GSAP’s
ScrollTrigger, which can tie the progress of an animation to the scrollbar. Keep these animations
lightweight; if Lottie, use the smallest JSON; if GSAP on images/SVG, ensure no huge DOM reflows.
Another idea: animate numeric counters for stats (e.g., a counter from 0 to 300 MW when the
Projects section comes into view, highlighting “300 MW under development”). Libraries like Framer
Motion have useAnimation or one can do a simple incremental counter in React. This kind of
animation adds excitement and draws attention to key metrics.
Performance & Preferences: Always provide a non-animated fallback. If animations are disabled
(prefers-reduced-motion media query), the site should still be fully usable. Design with performance
in mind: use GPU-accelerated CSS transforms (translate, opacity) for smooth animations, and avoid
heavy JS on main thread. Framer Motion and GSAP are both performance-optimized, but misuse can
still lag, so test on mid-range devices. For Next.js specifically, animations should be implemented in
client-side components (disable SSR for those if needed using dynamic import with ssr:false for
heavy animated components to avoid server rendering issues).
Recommended Dependencies:
Framer Motion: Great for React-based animations; you can easily animate JSX elements. For
example, animate presence for modals or page transitions. Next.js 13/15 can use the new App
Router with React 18 – you might handle route transitions by wrapping LayoutGroup or use
AnimatePresence on page changes for a smooth crossfade between pages. There are many
examples of page transitions using Framer Motion in Next .
GSAP: Excellent for complex timelines. If you want, say, a continuous floating animation of an object
(like an SVG of a buoy bobbing up and down indefinitely) or fine control over scroll progress
animations, GSAP is unrivaled. Use the official GSAP package; for ScrollTrigger, you’ll need to import
and register that plugin. GSAP can coexist with React – just be mindful of using useEffect to
initiate GSAP animations on refs after mount.
Others: React Scroll Parallax or Locomotive Scroll (for smooth scrolling effect) can add a polished
feel if desired, but these are optional. A simpler approach is to use CSS scroll-behavior:
smooth for anchor links (like clicking “Learn More” scrolls smoothly). If using heavy visual effects
(like WebGL or 3D), look into three.js or smaller canvas libraries, though likely not needed unless
you want a 3D model of KPP interactive on the site (advanced, can be skipped for now).
In implementation, start with small, meaningful animations – test them – and iterate. The goal is to
enhance the storytelling (e.g., emphasize how KPP works or how professional the company is) without
distracting or annoying the user. By using modern animation libraries and techniques carefully, the site will
feel dynamic and cutting-edge, aligning with the innovative nature of KPP technology.

Code Snippets
Below are example code snippets and component structures for key elements, using Next.js 15 (React 18)
and Tailwind CSS. These are simplified for clarity, but illustrate how to structure the layout and apply
styling/animation. The code is written as functional React components (assuming usage of Next.js App
Router or Pages as appropriate) with Tailwind utility classes. You can adapt class names and structure as
needed.
1. Navigation Bar (Header): A responsive header with logo and menu items. Uses Tailwind for layout;
Heroicons for a mobile menu icon. In Next.js, you’d typically place this in a layout file or _app.js . This
example shows a basic structure:
// components/Navbar.jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { Bars3Icon, XMarkIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/
outline'; // Heroicons for menu toggle
export default function Navbar() {
const [menuOpen, setMenuOpen] = useState(false);
const toggleMenu = () => setMenuOpen(!menuOpen);
return (
<nav className="w-full bg-white shadow-md fixed top-0 z-50">
<div className="container mx-auto flex items-center justify-between p-4">
{/* Logo / Brand Name */}
<Link href="/" className="text-2xl font-serif text-primary">
Deep Engineering
</Link>
{/* Desktop Menu */}
<ul className="hidden md:flex space-x-8 text-gray-800 font-medium">
<li><Link href="/about" className="hover:text-primary">About</Link></
li>
<li><Link href="/technology" className="hover:textprimary">
Technology</Link></li>
<li><Link href="/projects" className="hover:text-primary">Projects</
Link></li>
<li><Link href="/team" className="hover:text-primary">Team</Link></li>
<li><Link href="/contact" className="hover:text-primary">Contact</
Link></li>
</ul>
{/* Mobile Menu Button */}
<button className="md:hidden p-2 text-gray-800" onClick={toggleMenu}
aria-label="Toggle Menu">
{menuOpen ? <XMarkIcon className="h-6 w-6"/> : <Bars3Icon
className="h-6 w-6"/>}
9
</button>
</div>
{/* Mobile Menu Dropdown */}
{menuOpen && (
<div className="md:hidden bg-white border-t border-gray-200">
<ul className="flex flex-col px-4 py-2 space-y-2 text-gray-800">
<li><Link href="/about" onClick={toggleMenu}>About</Link></li>
<li><Link href="/technology" onClick={toggleMenu}>Technology</
Link></li>
<li><Link href="/projects" onClick={toggleMenu}>Projects</Link></li>
<li><Link href="/team" onClick={toggleMenu}>Team</Link></li>
<li><Link href="/contact" onClick={toggleMenu}>Contact</Link></li>
</ul>
</div>
)}
</nav>
);
}
Explanation: This Navbar uses a mobile-first approach. On medium screens ( md: breakpoint) and up, it
shows a horizontal menu. On small screens, it shows a hamburger icon (Bars3Icon) to toggle the menu. The
menu links use Next’s <Link> for client-side navigation. We apply a shadow and fixed positioning to
mimic a sticky header. The font-serif text-primary on the logo suggests using the brand serif font
and primary color (configured in Tailwind theme). The hover states change text to the primary color. This
component is compatible with Next.js and Tailwind out-of-the-box. It will be easy to include in the main
layout (e.g., in app/layout.jsx or _app.js ).
2. Hero Section: A full-screen hero with text and call-to-action, utilizing Tailwind for styling and optionally
Framer Motion for animation. Here’s a component example:
// components/HeroSection.jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'; // if using Framer Motion for animation
export default function HeroSection() {
return (
<section
className="relative flex items-center justify-center text-center bg-cover
bg-center"
style={{ minHeight: '100vh', backgroundImage: 'url("/hero-bg.jpg")' }}
>
<div className="bg-black bg-opacity-50 absolute inset-0"></div> {/*
overlay for contrast */}
<div className="relative z-10 px-4">

Explanation: This hero uses a full viewport height ( minHeight: 100vh ) with a background image (e.g.,
hero-bg.jpg in public folder – which could be an abstract energy-related image or video poster). We
overlay a semi-transparent black layer to ensure white text is readable. The content (h1, p, button) is
centered. We used Framer Motion’s <motion.h1> etc., to animate the elements on mount (sliding upward
from y:50 and fading in). The button is a simple anchor that could scroll to the Technology section (using a
fragment link). The Tailwind classes give us responsive font sizing (text-6xl on md for larger screens) and
spacing. We also show how to use a custom color class bg-primary and hover:bg-primary-dark –
these would be defined in Tailwind config to correspond to our brand colors (e.g., primary = deep blue,
primary-dark = slightly darker blue). The hero is set to position relative with children absolutely positioned
where needed; we ensure the text is above the overlay by using z-index. This hero is easily integrated into a
Next page (like pages/index.js or a homepage component).
3. Grid Layout (Technology Features Section): Using Tailwind’s grid to layout feature cards or technical
specs. For example, a section highlighting KPP features (Clean, Continuous, etc.) in a 3-column grid on
desktop, 1-column on mobile:
11
// components/FeaturesGrid.jsx
import { BoltIcon, GlobeAltIcon, ArrowsExpandIcon, DeviceMobileIcon } from
'@heroicons/react/24/outline';
// Example icons: Bolt for energy, Globe for anywhere, ArrowsExpand for
scalability, DeviceMobile as placeholder
export default function FeaturesGrid() {
const features = [
{ icon: BoltIcon, title: 'Clean Power', desc: 'No fuel or emissions – 100%
green energy.' },
{ icon: GlobeAltIcon, title: 'Continuous 24/7', desc: 'Uninterrupted
baseload power, day and night.' },
{ icon: DeviceMobileIcon, title: 'Decentralized', desc: 'Installable at the
point of need, even off-grid.' },
{ icon: ArrowsExpandIcon, title: 'Scalable & Modular', desc: 'From a few MW
to 100+ MW, expandable on demand.' },
];
return (
<section className="py-16 bg-gray-50">
<div className="container mx-auto px-4">
<h2 className="text-3xl font-serif font-semibold text-center textgray-
800 mb-12">Why KPP Technology?</h2>
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-8">
{features.map(({ icon: Icon, title, desc }) => (
<div key={title} className="flex flex-col items-center text-center
p-6 bg-white rounded shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
<Icon className="h-12 w-12 text-primary mb-4" />
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">{title}</
h3>
<p className="text-gray-600">{desc}</p>
</div>
))}
</div>
</div>
</section>
);
}
Explanation: We defined an array of features with an icon, title, and description. The Tailwind grid classes
create a responsive layout – 1 column on small, 2 on medium, 4 on x-large screens. Each feature card is
centered, with some padding, white background, and a subtle shadow. On hover (desktop), we elevate the
shadow to indicate interactivity (though these might not be clickable, it just adds a nice effect). Icons from
Heroicons are used (outline style) with a fixed size and the brand primary color ( text-primary ). The
section itself has a light gray background to distinguish it from other sections. We included a section
heading “Why KPP Technology?” centered above the grid. This kind of component could be used on the
12
Home or Technology page to summarize benefits. It’s easily customizable by changing icons or text, and the
structure is clear.
4. Project Cards (Projects Page): Illustrating a grid of project cards using Tailwind. This shows how to loop
through project data and create a consistent card layout:
// components/ProjectsList.jsx
const projects = [
{ name: 'Zakho 100MW', location: 'Kurdistan, Iraq', status: 'Planned – 2025',
description: 'Four 25MW KPP units to provide regional power.' },
{ name: 'Soran 100MW', location: 'Kurdistan, Iraq', status: 'Planned – 2025',
description: 'Baseload clean power for Northern Iraq.' },
{ name: 'Raparin 50MW', location: 'Kurdistan, Iraq', status: 'Planned –
2026', description: 'Expanding reliable energy access in Raparin.' },
{ name: 'Garmian 50MW', location: 'Kurdistan, Iraq', status: 'Planned –
2026', description: 'Sustainable power plant in development.' },
{ name: 'Samawah 90MW', location: 'Al-Muthana, Iraq', status: 'In
Development', description: 'Flagship KPP project with Board of Investment.' }
];
export default function ProjectsList() {
return (
<section className="py-16 bg-white">
<div className="container mx-auto px-4">
<h2 className="text-3xl font-serif font-semibold text-center textgray-
800 mb-10">Our Projects</h2>
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
{projects.map(project => (
<div key={project.name}
className="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6 hover:shadow-lg transition">
<h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary
mb-1">{project.name}</h3>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2">{project.location} –
<em>{project.status}</em></p>
<p className="text-gray-700">{project.description}</p>
</div>
))}
</div>
</div>
</section>
);
}
Explanation: This component creates a grid of project cards. We simulate project data in an array – in a real
site this might come from a CMS. The grid goes from 1 column on mobile to 2 on md to 3 on xl, to nicely fill
space. Each card has a light border and rounded corners. On hover, we add a larger shadow for a lift effect.
13
The project name is shown as a heading in the brand color, with location and status in a smaller, muted text.
This demonstrates using Tailwind utility classes for spacing ( mb-1 , mb-2 etc.) and text styling. The code is
straightforward and highlights how content can be dynamically rendered from data. This layout is static-site
friendly (just mapping data) and responsive. If needed, you could link each card to a detailed project page
by wrapping <Link href={ /projects/${slug} }> around the card contents.
5. Contact Form: Lastly, a contact form structure with Tailwind. This can be made to submit to an API route
or third-party. Here’s a simplified version (without actual submission logic):
// components/ContactForm.jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
export default function ContactForm() {
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ name: '', email: '', message:
'' });
const [sent, setSent] = useState(false);
const handleChange = e => {
setFormData({ ...formData, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
};
const handleSubmit = async e => {
e.preventDefault();
// TODO: send formData to an API or service
setSent(true);
};
return (
<section className="py-16 bg-gray-50" id="contact">
<div className="container mx-auto px-4 max-w-lg">
<h2 className="text-3xl font-serif font-semibold text-center textgray-
800 mb-8">Get in Touch</h2>
{!sent ? (
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="space-y-4">
<div>
<label className="block text-gray-700 mb-1" htmlFor="name">Name</
label>
<input
type="text" name="name" id="name" required
className="w-full border border-gray-300 rounded px-3 py-2
focus:outline-none focus:border-primary"
placeholder="Your Name"
value={formData.name} onChange={handleChange}
/>
</div>
<div>
14
<label className="block text-gray-700 mb-1"
htmlFor="email">Email</label>
<input
type="email" name="email" id="email" required
className="w-full border border-gray-300 rounded px-3 py-2
focus:outline-none focus:border-primary"
placeholder="you@example.com"
value={formData.email} onChange={handleChange}
/>
</div>
<div>
<label className="block text-gray-700 mb-1"
htmlFor="message">Message</label>
<textarea
name="message" id="message" rows="4" required
className="w-full border border-gray-300 rounded px-3 py-2
focus:outline-none focus:border-primary"
placeholder="How can we help you?"
value={formData.message} onChange={handleChange}
/>
</div>
<button
type="submit"
className="w-full bg-primary text-white font-medium py-3 px-6
rounded hover:bg-primary-dark transition-colors"
>
Send Message
</button>
</form>
) : (
<p className="text-center text-green-600 text-lg">Thank you! Your
message has been sent.</p>
)}
</div>
</section>
);
}
Explanation: This form collects name, email, and message. Tailwind is used to style labels and inputs. We
give inputs a border and change border color on focus to the brand primary (for a clear focus state). The
button is styled with the primary color and a hover state. The component manages local state just to show a
success message on submission (in a real app, you’d integrate with an API or use a service like Formspree or
a Next.js API route to handle emails). The form section is centered with a max width to not stretch too wide.
All text is legible and the layout is mobile-friendly (full width fields). By using this as a controlled component
with React state, we can easily integrate validation or sending logic. If connected to a CMS, the contact info
(like recipient email) might be configured there, but the form itself is largely front-end code. The use of
id="contact" also allows the hero “Learn More” button or nav links to scroll here if needed.
15
These code snippets illustrate a consistent approach: using Next.js Link for routing, Tailwind for utility-first
styling (with a design system of colors/fonts configured), and integrating animation or interaction with
React hooks and libraries. All components should be placed appropriately in the Next.js structure (e.g.,
pages or app directory). For deployment on Vercel, no special changes are needed – Next.js is Vercel’s firstclass
citizen. For cPanel hosting, which typically doesn’t run Node servers, we should build the site as a
static export. That means using Next.js Static Site Generation (SSG) for all pages and avoiding runtime
Node dependencies. The code above is compatible with SSG (no unauthorized server-side code). We’d run
next build && next export to get static HTML/CSS/JS, which can then be uploaded to a cPanel host.
Ensure that any dynamic data (e.g., from CMS) is fetched at build time (or use ISR – Incremental Static
Regeneration – if on a platform that supports Node functions; but cPanel likely means pure static). Also,
avoid features like Next.js API routes or Server Actions that require a Node environment, or replace them
with external services (for the contact form, for instance, use a third-party or a serverless function on Vercel
called via JS). By keeping the site mostly static, you ensure it runs on cPanel without issues. Tailwind CSS will
purge and minimize the CSS on build, resulting in fast load times.
Pro Tip: When integrating these components, test each in isolation and as part of the whole site. Next.js 15
(if using App Router) might allow you to co-locate some components and possibly use new features (like
React Server Components), but for simplicity, treat these as client components (especially ones with state or
animation). Use the Next.js Image component for any actual <img> for optimized loading (just ensure to
configure domains or use static imports for local images). Also configure your Tailwind theme (in
tailwind.config.js ) to include the brand colors (primary, etc.) and fonts (Crimson Pro, Heebo via
@import or link). This way classes like text-primary or font-serif map to your desired styles.
By following these code patterns, developers can rapidly build out the site’s front-end. The structure is
modular (each section in its own component), and the styling is consistent via Tailwind. The result will be a
site that is not only visually aligned with the design guide but also built with best practices for Next.js and
modern CSS.
CMS Compatibility
To manage content efficiently, integrating a Headless CMS is recommended. The site should support visual
editing and static site generation. Here are three CMS options with their benefits, any of which can work
well with Next.js:
Sanity: A flexible headless CMS with strong support for structured content and a customizable
editing interface. Sanity would allow you to define schemas for each content type (pages, projects,
team members, etc.). It pairs well with Next.js’s static generation: you can fetch data at build time via
Sanity’s GROQ queries, and revalidate content on updates. Sanity recently introduced a Visual
Editing mode that lets editors see their changes on the live site in real-time . This means content
creators can click on the site and edit content inline, bridging the studio and the site preview. Sanity’s
strengths include real-time collaboration (multiple editors), a rich text editor for long content, and
the ability to handle references (e.g., a project entry can reference team members, etc.). You can host
Sanity’s backend for free up to certain usage, and it integrates with Next.js via official libraries
( @sanity/client ). For static export, you’d likely use Sanity’s webhook to trigger a new build when
content changes, since static files need rebuilding to update. Many Next.js projects use Sanity for its
mix of developer flexibility and editor experience.

Storyblok: A headless CMS known for its visual editor that is extremely user-friendly for nondevelopers.
In Storyblok, content is organized in a component-based manner (bloks) which maps
well to Next.js components. The Visual Editor loads your site in an iframe and allows editors to click
on components to edit content, seeing changes live . This is great for a marketing-heavy site or
when the content structure might change often. For example, the marketing team could rearrange
the homepage sections by reordering bloks in Storyblok. Storyblok also supports static site
generation – you would use their API to fetch content at build time. They have a JS SDK and even
example starters for Next. One advantage is that editors can create new pages or sections without
developer intervention, if you set up the component model flexibly. It’s a commercial SaaS (with a
free tier for small sites), and it’s very popular for its editor experience. If a true WYSIWYG editing
experience is a priority, Storyblok is a top choice . For deployment, similar to Sanity, you’d rebuild
or use incremental static regeneration on content changes (Storyblok can ping a webhook on
publish).
Netlify CMS (Decap CMS): An open-source, git-based CMS that lives in your repo. This would add an
/admin interface to the site where editors can log in (usually via GitHub or other OAuth) and edit
Markdown/YAML content which lives in the repository. The benefit is simplicity and zero cost: content
is stored as flat files, and when editors make changes, it commits to Git. This works with static site
generation nicely because a new commit triggers a rebuild (if using Netlify or any CI/CD). Netlify CMS
provides a fairly traditional form-based interface (not a visual inline editor), but it is user-friendly and
can be configured for different collections (blog posts, projects, etc.). For a site like Deep
Engineering, you could set up collections for Projects, Team, and static pages content (like About
page text, which editors can then update). The editorial workflow (drafts, previews) is supported but
not as instantaneous as Sanity/Storyblok. The advantage is that everything is version-controlled and
there’s no external DB – the site content is self-contained. This CMS might be suitable if you want to
keep things simple and within Git, and if real-time visual editing is less important than having a
straightforward editing form. Since it’s called Decap CMS now (recent rebrand), it’s still the same
under the hood: a React app that publishes to git. With Next.js, you’d likely write a script to parse the
markdown (or use next-mdx-remote or similar) at build time. There are plenty of examples of
using Netlify CMS with Next.
(Honorable mentions): TinaCMS is another visual editing toolkit that can provide inline editing on a
Next.js site (Tina can be git-backed like Netlify CMS but with inline editing). Also Contentful or
DatoCMS are headless CMS with good Next integration, though they don’t have true visual editing
(just preview). Since the prompt specifically mentioned Sanity, Storyblok, Netlify CMS, the above
focus on those.
CMS Integration Considerations:
Whichever CMS you choose, structure your content models to match the site’s IA. For example, in Sanity/
Storyblok you might have a “Homepage” singleton with fields for the hero tagline, subtagline, etc., plus a list
of references to feature blocks or project highlights. An “About” singleton with the company info and maybe
an array for team members (or separate Team collection). For “Technology” pages, since there are multiple
subpages, a flexible approach is needed – either each subpage is its own entry in a “TechPage” collection
(with a type or slug identifying which aspect it is), or a single “KPP Technology” entry that holds all subsections
(maybe not ideal for large content). Given the site’s structure, treating each page (Overview, How it
•
32
33
•
•
17
Works, etc.) as separate entries might be clean. Then your Next.js pages can fetch those by a known slug or
ID.
Static Generation Workflow: Ensure the CMS supports triggering rebuilds or using ISR: - With Vercel, you
can use Next.js Incremental Static Regeneration. For example, set a revalidate on pages so they check
for new content every X seconds, or better, use On-Demand Revalidation: configure the CMS to call a
special revalidation API route on content publish (Next 12+ supports res.revalidate('/page') in API
routes). That way, editors publish and the site updates without full redeploy. This works for Vercel hosting. -
If you intend to export to static and host on GoDaddy cPanel, you won’t have on-demand revalidation –
you’d need to manually rebuild and upload, or have a CI pipeline that does this on CMS changes. In that
scenario, a git-based CMS (Netlify CMS) might actually streamline things (because committing content
triggers your build pipeline automatically via GitHub Actions or similar). Sanity/Storyblok would require a
build hook set up on an external service (like GitHub Action that runs next export and deploys via FTP to
cPanel, for example).
Visual Editing: Both Sanity and Storyblok offer visual editing where the site is loaded for preview and
clicking text highlights the field in the CMS. For Sanity, you’d use their Content Source Map and perhaps
their @sanity/visual-editing toolkit which connects the Next site to Sanity Studio . Storyblok’s
visual editor is more out-of-the-box (just add the Storyblok script and it overlays edit buttons on your site). If
having this feature is a priority for the client (so marketing folks can see exactly what they’re doing),
Storyblok might edge out others. However, Sanity’s new Studio (v3) with Live Preview is also quite powerful,
just a tad more setup.
CMS UI and Content Team: Consider who will use it. If the Deep Engineering team has technical folks,
Sanity’s structured content is fine. If they prefer a more WYSIWYG/page-builder feel, Storyblok could be
better. Netlify CMS is okay for a smaller team comfortable with forms and can be self-hosted easily (just
protect the admin with Netlify Identity or GitHub login).
Conclusion: Any of these CMS can be made to work with a Next.js static site; the decision will depend on
budget, desired editing experience, and workflow. Storyblok and Sanity are proven with Next.js for static
sites (many case studies exist). Sanity provides a robust backend with querying, which is great if you need to
do more complex data relationships (it’s almost like a database + CMS). Storyblok provides an excellent
authoring experience with its visual composer , which might result in faster content iteration. Netlify
CMS keeps everything in-house and simple, which is appealing for a straightforward content structure and
if you want to avoid external services.
From a developer standpoint, initial setup for Sanity or Storyblok will take a bit of time (defining schemas or
components), but once in place, they greatly ease content management and scaling the site (e.g., adding a
new project is just filling a form). The site as planned (with projects, team, multi-page tech content) would
benefit from a CMS to avoid hardcoding these into the Next.js code.
Recommendation: Evaluate the team’s needs – if they want to frequently update technical content and see
it as they edit, Storyblok might be the top choice for its intuitive visual editor . If they value flexibility
and might build more custom logic around content (or even use the content in other apps), Sanity is
excellent and now also has visual editing capabilities. If low cost and simplicity are paramount, Netlify
(Decap) CMS will do the job with a bit less polish in the editor UI. All options support static generation and
will work with the design we outlined.

Regardless of choice, ensure the build and deployment pipeline is configured: for example, on Vercel, set up
webhooks so that publishing in the CMS triggers POST /api/revalidate for the pages or triggers a
new build if using static export; on a traditional hosting, you might rely on manual deploy unless you set up
continuous deployment via Git.
By following this guide, the Deep Engineering website will be built to modern standards – aesthetically
inspired by an industry leader (Vestas), with well-organized content and navigation, engaging yet
professional copy, cohesive visuals, smooth interactive touches, clean code, and a content management
setup that keeps the site maintainable long-term. The result will be a site that impresses visitors and
effectively communicates Deep Engineering’s technical prowess and vision for renewable energy.
